To do threading, whe need to know the time at witch an event (index_pulse, sync_pulse) occured
The accuracy is determind by the delay between an event and the acutal action (start moving, adjusting speed)
There CPU cycle counter can be used to track time with a 240 Mhz resolution (4 us);
The CPU cycle counter is 32 bits resulting in a ~18 seconds range
Together with an overflow counter, whe have an adequate time measuring, comparable to the grbl-l & grbl-l-mega solution

The first test is to measure the RPM using the tics between events. The RPM can be shown on the Oled during status updates.
First test by showing the tic count. It will show the jitter in tics.
